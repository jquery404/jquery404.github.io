# Welcome

- 1st part: evaluate the benefits of an exo- and egocentric perspective in multi-user collaboration
give user two options 
    - suggestive transition  
    - automatic transition

- 2nd part: evaluate the benefits of having multiple points of view in large-scale collaboration
which is the added benefit of having a 360-degree camera
    - since the AR/VR user's views are limited by his field of view (which is less than 360) having view transition form multiple users can be helpful
    - I can compare this with the field of view and without it.

ideally you'd do :
**manual view switching with no suggestions** vs **suggested view switching** vs **automatic view switching**

Supporting multiple remote user to interact with multiple ar spaces

Exploring â€¦ 
Contextualise limit of 10 people

Varies people 
Limitation : currently 2 users

AR user will try both system = 2
VR both use the systems
All 3 experiments spaces

System design 
..
Is that sound like a plan
Yeah potentially
