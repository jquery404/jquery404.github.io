- 1st part: evaluate the benefits of an exo- and egocentric perspective in multi-user collaboration
give user two options 
    - suggestive transition
    - automatic transition

- 2nd part: evaluate the benefits of having multiple points of view in large-scale collaboration
which is the added benefit of having a 360-degree camera
    - since the AR/VR user's views are limited by his field of view (which is less than 360) having view transition form multiple users can be helpful
    - I can compare this with the field of view and without it.

### Feedback

- hard to focus on HUD object in AR (VR view more clearer)
- AVATAR and HUD need someway to sync
- AVATAR position was confusing 
- GUIDE/TUTORIAL is a must to have.
